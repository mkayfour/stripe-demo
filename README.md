Consists of a basic demo of stripe code - React and Node Js to recieve payments using Credit/Debit Cards !

Incase, you want to see PPT which I used for demo :

Front-end code is in Client directory whereas Backend code is in root directory. Create a stripe account to get API keys. Replace the keys in respective .env files.

Steps to use:
1. Download/Clone the repository.
2. Do "npm install" in root and in client directory
3. Replace values of secret key (backend) and public key (frontend) in envs provided.
4. To run backend, "npm run start" in root directory
5. To run frontend, "npm start" in client directory
6. Go to localhost:3000 

Just incase, the API keys give you error, consider putting them directly as string and not through the env's.
